Overview
------------

This is the accompanying code repository for the paper Weigert et al. (2021) - ''Semiparametric APC analysis of destination choice patterns: Using generalized additive models to quantify the impact of age, period and cohort on travel distances''.

The code contains the R code for all relevant analyses in the paper, including the supplementary material.
The data in this repository is a randomly drawn 20% sample of the full dataset, which we are not allowed to make freely available.
